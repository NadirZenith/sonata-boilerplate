# This script populates a git repository with the content of a working repository
# The idea is to include everything into one repository to avoid calling composer
# or any pre processing tools while deploying
#
# Setup:
#    mkdir build    # the path where the final build reposository will be located
#    git init build # initialize a git repository (can be a git fetch if a remote is available)
#    mkdir project  # the project to build
#
# The command need to be called like this:
#    bin/qa_build_git.sh . ../build 1.0.0 1.0.0-DEV
#
#    This command will update the build repository by switching to the 1.0.0-DEV and then creating
#    or switching to the 1.0.0 branch. Switching first to the 1.0.0-DEV will help to keep the repository
#    small as the diff will be small.
#
# Configuration
#    There is no configuration file, however you can tweak some commands to match your needs
#    Also, make sure all paths are configured properly (like, assets with no symlinks)
#
# Deploy can be done by using
#    git fetch
#    git checkout 1.0.0-DEV
